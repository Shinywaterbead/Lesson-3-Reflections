1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you want to share your work with others, or invite others to collaborate on a project with you. It's also a nice way to keep your work accessible wherever you go!

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Much like why you wouldn't want your changes to be auto-saved, it's good to be asked before you commit your changes.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of repositories within GitHub, and only happen within GitHub. Clones take an existing repository and make one just like it, and it can be remote or local. Branches are paths that exist on a single repository.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a local copy ensures that you have a chance to commit your work and make commit messages before uploading. It also helps you work without internet access.


5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'm not sure. Through email? Side by side pairing? Screen sharing?

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
